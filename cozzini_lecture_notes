Hyper Threading --> because of overlaping squares you won't get %100 speed.
It is like if you have 8 cores you can use it as almost 16 cores with hyperthreading
Generally bad for hpc because --> they are doing same thing with the different data. Overhead causing the disadvantage.

Opteron 6xxx AMD CPU
4 NUMA zone and 2 socket (every socket has two groups of cores and every group of cores has their own zones)

Intel uses QPI --> Quick PAth Interconntect

Challenges or multicores (memory)
mpi processes can be changed (for cores) by linux os.
Tools --> Numactl, 
ccNuma --> cache coheriance ...
Stream benchmark (add ,scalar etc)
contention, compressure (slow donw calculation) -- reason for reducing stream results in ullyse
